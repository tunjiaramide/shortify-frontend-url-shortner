        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
            <p>These terms outline the guidelines for accessing and using ShotURL, 
                including its features, content, and services, whether you are a guest or 
                a registered user.  </p>

            <p>Please review these terms carefully before using the site. By accessing or using 
                ShotURL, you agree to abide by these terms. </p> 

            <p>ShotURL provides a link-shortening service that converts long URLs from websites, 
                blogs, forums, or social media into compact links that can be easily shared 
                across different platforms.</p>

        <h2>Conditions of Use</h2>

            <p>To ensure our service remains free and accessible, users must agree to the 
                following conditions when using our platform:</p>

            <p>Users are not allowed to create shortened URLs that redirect to the following 
                types of content:</p>

            <li>Copyrighted material, including videos, audio, images, books, and games.</li>

            <li>Not found, blank, or expired pages.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Any shortened URL that directs to a landing page violating the above conditions 
            will be disabled. Our team reviews all created URLs, and if we detect spam or any 
            form of misuse that breaches our terms of service, the shortened URL will be removed 
            without prior notice.</p>
        <p>If you need to update or modify a shortened URL you created, please submit a request 
            through our contact form, including both the original long URL and the shortened version. 
            Our team will assess whether the update is possible.</p>

                due to contract, negligence, strict liability, or other legal theories. However, 
                some jurisdictions may not allow certain liability exclusions, so these limitations may not 
                apply in all cases.</p>
